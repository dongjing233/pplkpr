<h1>Feedback</h1>
    <p>Pplkpr is a collaboration between Lauren McCarthy and Kyle McDonald. Both designers have profound understandings about human-human and human-machine relationships. This project is an experimental app and art project, a group of students from Carnegie Mellon University were being monitored and their social lives were being controlled for a whole week.

<h1>My Feedback</h1>
<p>
Is it true? Do we really need algorithms to help us manipulate our own life? Are computers making more rational decisions than we do? Which is more important in a social relationship, emotional attachment or rational connection? Why do we need an app to substitute ourselves in a social relationship? Are we being so selfish and passive in maintaining a social relationship? Or maybe the app really helps because we are being cowards when dealing with toxic relationships...
