<h1>Introduction</h1>
        
<p>
Pplkpr is consists of two parts: a smartwatch that detects users’ movements, emotions, and relationships; and an app that analyzes the data gathered by the smartwatch and auto-manage users’ relationships. Pplkpr tried to optimize users’ relationships with their surroundings.
</p>

    
<p>
The smartwatch is actually a heart rate wristband with GPS tracking function. Initially, I thought using the heart rate as an indication of emotion was not accurate because the variation of heart rate may be caused by many other factors. After researching the technology they have implemented,  I found the algorithm was much accurate than I perceived. A complex metric called "heart rate variability" was used to detect subtle changes in heart rhythm to determine users’ emotional state. The emotion-sensing system works with the GPS to tell the users what kind of interactions they are having with each person and how to re-schedule their social time spending with each people. Pplkpr adds more time the users spend with the people who interact positively with them and deletes the people who are influencing the users negatively.
</p>

<p>
Pplkpr app sends notices to the users when they are hanging out with someone or feeling emotional. The users can fill out the details about why they are having this kind of emotion and the app automatically figures out what happens to the trend of users’ emotions. Users are allowed to see who is making them feel emotional and how each people influence their emotions. As I mentioned, the app reschedules users’ social patterns. The app achieves this goal by messaging certain people and invite them to hang out, at the same time, block the unfriendly people’s messages.
